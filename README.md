> The exclusive NUS voice chat web-app for anything and everything NUS.

## Motivation:

Having gone through the first-year of university during the COVID-19 pandemic, we realised that there was one thing that was fundamentally missing in our lives as students--social interaction. We missed complaining about lectures, talking to friends and classmates, providing or requesting help for anything school-related, or just the simple small talk.

Current platforms and services, while fulfilling the role of remote communication, have felt lacking in some way as they are too clunky--coming in a form of a written medium, needing to schedule calls and getting specific parties onboard, or the invite links get lost in the inbox. 

_Sounds familiar?_

## Aim

NUS Clubhouse is a voice-chat platform that is easy to use and navigate, and would fill the social void during this pandemic, all while catering to the student life that many had looked forward to.

## Ideal users
1. NUS students looking to discuss controversial/interesting topics (best food in NUS, hall life, COVID changes, cheating in exams, making friends in online university, etc)
2. CCA/Camp organisers looking for ways to market their CCAs/camps to NUS students that don’t know they exist (hard to discover NUS camp details without friends/connections)
3. NUS students looking for more info about specific mods from wider range of students (reviews in NUSmods takes more effort, high chance reviewer did well--survivorship bias)
4. NUS professors/seniors/TAs setting up Q&A for newer NUS students looking for general school/life advice (hard to set up casual/informal Q&A sessions and attract students to attend them through existing platforms)
5. Students who believe that they can provide entertaining content in their own way, through setting up NUS-based podcasts (with their friends or other students as guests), showing their creativity by covering songs or debuting their original work to the student community.


## Existing ways
1. Online forums like r/nus on Reddit or group chats with friends (hard to have deeper discussion live on online forums due to longer/unknown reply times and nature of text forums)
2. Marketing via word-of-mouth through friends, posters, social media, website (hard to connect to NUS students who aren’t following their social media accounts)
3. Can only find reviews on r/nus or NUSmods (may not be sufficiently detailed or updated)
4. Can only ask friends or search for course intro briefings (can be hard to find)
5. Streaming on other platforms such as Twitch/YouTube/Facebook to a very small audience. 

## Scope of Project

The web-based application would serve as a platform where users such as students, professors, or teaching assistants of the NUS community can create rooms for their own specific uses such as module topic discussion or current affairs. Those rooms would be open any user to join and listen or participate in

    - <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Beyond Orbital timeframe</span>:
        1. Private rooms (password needed to enter)
        2. Replay rooms (available for 24 hours from when the room closed)
        3. Export rooms (upload events that happened in the room, podcast/performances, to other platforms)

## How we are different from similar platforms

1. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Skype</span>
    * No need to specifically call an add people into calls to have a discussion among multiple people

2. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Zoom</span>
    * No longer need to look through emails or chat groups to find links to the appropriate Zoom room
